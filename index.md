I am currently a software engineer at Tetration Analytics (acquired by Cisco) working on machine learning methods for cybersecurity.

Previously, I was a data scientist/machine learning engineer at WalmartLabs where I worked on making better search experience for walmart.com, recommendation algorithms and optimization methods for online marketing.

Earlier, I was a PhD student at [CS, UMN](https://www.cs.umn.edu) working on numerical linear algebra and optimization methods for matrix completion and dimensionality reduction. My advisor is [Prof. Yousef Saad](http://www.cs.umn.edu/~saad).
