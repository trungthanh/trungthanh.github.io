I am currently a machine learning software engineer at Google working in the Ads team.

Previously, I was at Tetration Analytics (acquired by Cisco) exploring and driving data driven methods for cybersecurity including scalable real-time anomaly detection for time series and text data, graph partitioning and clustering, rules engine and ML systems.

Before that, I was a data scientist/software engineer at WalmartLabs where I worked on making better search experience for walmart.com, recommendation algorithms and optimization and multi-armed bandits for online marketing.

Earlier, I was a PhD student at [CS, UMN](https://www.cs.umn.edu) working on numerical linear algebra and optimization methods for matrix completion and dimensionality reduction. My advisor is [Prof. Yousef Saad](http://www.cs.umn.edu/~saad).
